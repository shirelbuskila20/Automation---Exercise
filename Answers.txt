a. Test this UI mock-up, can you find any problems with this screen? (Please pay
attention to all functional aspects such as Security, Usability, Performance, etc.).

* The amount to pay should appear more clearly, different from the input elements
* the amount does not display currency
* not enough vertical spacing between items
* cardholder name appears below card number input and may be confusing (the user might type the name instead of number)
* missing the CVV number of the credit card
* bad grouping of items - the 2 columns are confusing, it would probably be easier for the user to have a single column 
* The button label “continue” is not meaningful, as it seems it proceeds to payment therefore it should be labeled as “Confirm payment” or “proceed payment”
* The card type should show “select type” and not a default value (for consistency with other elements)
* hopefully if the some input is invalid it is expected that previous input is remembered in the form
* the button continue (proceed to pay) should appear different from the cancel button, in general cancel buttons are gray and action buttons are colored


b. Can you write 2–3 sample test cases for this functionality?

* Submit a blank form. (X)
* Enter letters in credit card number and zip codeand numbers in first name and last name. (X)
* Submit a form with valid values. (V)

c. Can you suggest a product solution for the most severe bug you’ve found?

I think the most severe bug is that the credit card CVV number field is missing.
To fix it I will add a new field where the user could fill in the CVV code because without it won't be possible to check the validity of the credit card.
